You should first familiarize yourself with its functionality by going through the brief [tutorial](http://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.9.1/tutorial/index.html). For this homework, you may only use the basic undirected graph methods listed [here](http://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.9.1/reference/classes.graph.html).\n",
